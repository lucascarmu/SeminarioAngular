          <h3>What is Gluten Free?</h3>
          <p>
            Gluten refers to a group of proteins found in wheat and other grains like barley and rye. Some people are sensitive or allergic to gluten, which can cause various health issues. Gluten-free products are those that do not contain these proteins, making them safe for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.
